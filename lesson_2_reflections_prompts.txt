What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	A .git folder containing all metadata used by git is created. You need to do it because otherwise git won't be able
	to track your changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	It is different because it only "contains" the files you decided to commit, this is important because it offers you
	a possibility of choosing which files you want to add to a commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	You can use git diff to compare what changes has been made and then decide which file to commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	Branches would be helpful when you want to make a change to the logic of you application, if you want to fix a bug 
	or simply want to update your documentation. They would help because if something wrong happen, for instance 
	something that might break your code, you will leave your working application untouched and you can experiment 
	changes into a branch.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	They help you figure out which commits belong to which branch, making it easier to read the history of each 
	branch and understand which commits are unrelated each other.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
	We now have one branch which contains all the commits made for coins branch and master branch ordered by timestamp.
	Because with two merged branches we're able to show the history with both branches commits included.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
	If the changes don't affect the same lines on the same files then git automatic merging is really useful, you don't
	have to go file to file line to line searching for the differences because git does the job for you. But in case 
	there are conflicts git couldn't know which changes to keep so you have to go manually.
